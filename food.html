                        The purpose is to preserve these protein-rich foods that can quickly spoil for a long time.
                        There are two mechanisms for preservation in this way: dehydration and the antibacterial properties of absorbed smoke. 
                        Nowadays, the enhanced flavor of smoked foods makes it a dish in many cultures.</td>


   
                    <td colspan="1" align="middle">Tempoyak Daun is a traditional food among the community in Kuala Pilah, Negeri Sembilan. The main ingredients are cassava sprouts, pumpkin and long beans.

                        The uniqueness of this dish is using 99 types of wood leaves which are very difficult to find these days. In the past, 99 types of wood leaves were easy to find because many people planted them, 
                        but now there are fewer and fewer because only people who are old are skilled at those wood leaves. Usually the wood leaves are planted on the side of the house or found in the forest area.
