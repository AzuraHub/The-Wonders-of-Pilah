                        before Malaysia’s independence in 19571. 
                        The Federated Malay States, established in 1895, consisted of four protected states in the Malay 
                        Peninsula—Selangor, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang. 
                        Kuala Pilah, being a part of Negeri Sembilan, was thus under this federation.
                        During the early 20th century, Kuala Pilah was known for its tin mining industry. 
                        There was even a railway line from Kuala Pilah to Bahau, serving the tin mining industry at 
                        Parit Tinggi for about 20 years from 1910.</td>
