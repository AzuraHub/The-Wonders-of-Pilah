                        Elevating the spirits of the Chinese community this Chinese New Year, the magnificent 
                        Si Thian Kong Temple in Kuala Pilah has become a popular tourist destination in the state due 
                        to its uniqueness and an abundance of colorful neon and LED lights.
                        The house of worship is a symbol of the Chinese community's pride and has historical significance 
                        of its own. Seeing the panorama at night through the building's many colorful lights is more captivating.
                        Over 2,000 lanterns were hung throughout the temple grounds, and the vibrant light also accentuatedthe decorations on the tiger statue and other items.<br />

                        Ulu Bendul Recreational Forest is a popular location for day trips and picnics because it's quiet and easily accessible. In Negeri Sembilan, the recreational forest lies in the area between Kuala Pilah and Seremban. Angsi Forest Reserve is where it is tucked away. Wading along the meandering stream or swimming in the pond, Ulu Bendul is surrounded by lush natural vegetation. The river is lined with boulders, which prevent the water from flowing naturally and instead cause it to flow quickly, almost like a natural jacuzzi, relieving tension and massaging exhausted muscles! To let the cascading water's healing effects, simply recline against the rock. <br />

                        The palace that is commonly mentioned in this context is an ancient, wooden structure that is still standing and was used as the Yang di-Pertuan Besar of 
                        Negeri Sembilan's official residence in the early 1900s. The palace's "role" has now been changed to museum since it is a historical landmark. The architecture of the Minangkabau 
                        community was taken into consideration when constructing this structure.<br />
